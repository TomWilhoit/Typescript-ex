# Typescript-ex

Frontend for "Word of the Day" type application using TypeScript and React for practice.

I wanted to push myself into the TypeScript world, so this was a learning spike in that direction.

The frontend is deployed [here](https://typescript-ex.herokuapp.com/ "Here")

This application fetches against a Node.js server deployed to Heroku [here](https://node-practice-be.herokuapp.com/ "Here")

The backend repo can be found [here](https://github.com/TomWilhoit/Typescript-server "Here") 

Critiques are very welcome! I am new to TypeScript and would love feedback.

Snapshot of the application in action:
